# [Atlas of interactions](https://skygraph.art)

The BSky Atlas is a visualization of graph data.

Previously, Atlas by Jaz https://github.com/ericvolp12/bsky-graph graph data (graph.json) was built by the Graph Builder in [`bsky-experiments`](https://github.com/ericvolp12/bsky-experiments).

This fork of Atlas does not support `graph.json` format as it has been reworked in a non-backward compatible way.
