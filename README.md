# Graph Visual Engine

Web engine for layered visualization of graph data.
Example: [skygraph.art](https://skygraph.art)

Based on Atlas by Jaz https://github.com/ericvolp12/bsky-graph.

This fork of Atlas does not support `graph.json` format as it has been reworked in a non-backward compatible way.
